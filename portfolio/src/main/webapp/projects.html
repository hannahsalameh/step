    <h1> GoNotes </h1>
    <p>Right after CSSI, I delved into creating a google chrome extension. GoNotes was created to work as a TODO list that was present on each new page visited. I created GoNotes as a way to keep things I need to do in the foreview of my thought and so I could jot down notes at a whim. This project is still in development. </p>
    <p> To download the current version of GoNotes, go <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gonotes/lnheclbpjkkoocnpmbobhamfkfpblnlm?hl=en"> here </a> </p>

    <h1> Kravings </h1>
    <p> Kravings was an webapp I created for Google CSSI last summer. The purpose of the app was to recommend users food when they are unsure of what to eat. It fulfilled this purpose through a quiz that recommends you a food, plus a randomizer button if the quiz results aren't sufficient. It also utilizes Yelp API to suggest locations to get whatever food item is recommended.</p>
    <p> Kravings was made with google appengine and utilizes python, html, css, and javascript to be able to function. All code for Kravings is public on my github (link in about page) </p>
